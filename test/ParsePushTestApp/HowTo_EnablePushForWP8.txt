Notes
1. Parse currently only supports toast notifications (ref)
2. If a toast notification is received and the app is in foreground, it will not be shown in general. See exception under section 'How it works' at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj662938(v=vs.105).aspx

Issues encountered:
1. {"code":135,"error":"at least one ID field (installationId,deviceToken) must be specified in this operation"}
Not sure yet at what point this happens but I think it's in parse4cn1

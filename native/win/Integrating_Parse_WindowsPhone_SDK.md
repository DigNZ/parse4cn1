# Updating the Windows Phone Parse SDK

This page describes how to integrate/update the official Parse Windows Phone SDK. 
<!--
The currently used version can be seen from the suffix of the `Parse-<version>.jar` in the `/native/win` [native code directory](https://github.com/sidiabale/parse4cn1/tree/master/native/win) of parse4cn1.
-->

> Note that updating to the latest SDK shouldn't be needed as parse4cn1 only uses the SDK for installation and push notification-related functionality which is not likely to change quite often. However, the following steps describe the process of updating the SDK, should the need ever arise.

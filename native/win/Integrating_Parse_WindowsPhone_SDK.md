# Updating the Windows Phone Parse SDK

At the time of writing (October 2015), the CN1 Windows Phone port does not support accessing native code. Therefore, there is no point of integrating the SDK in parse4cn1. Integration of the SDK can be easily done via NuGet in Visual Studio as explained in the Parse Push [setup guide](https://github.com/sidiabale/parse4cn1/wiki/Setting-Up-Push-For-WindowsPhone) for Windows Phone.
